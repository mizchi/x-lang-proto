-- Unison advantages demonstration

-- 1. Native Content-Addressed Storage
-- In Unison, every definition is automatically content-addressed
-- The hash of this function is computed from its implementation

  "Unison native content-addressing benefits:\n" ++
  "✅ Automatic hash computation for all definitions\n" ++
  "✅ Built-in cryptographic integrity\n" ++
  "✅ Distributed-by-default codebase\n" ++
  "✅ No hash collision worries (Merkle trees)\n" ++
  "✅ Immutable references prevent inconsistency\n" ++
  "✅ Refactoring preserves semantic equivalence"

-- 2. Type Safety and Algebraic Data Types
-- Unison's type system prevents many runtime errors

typeSafetyBenefits : Text
typeSafetyBenefits = 
  "Type safety advantages:\n" ++
  "✅ Exhaustive pattern matching\n" ++
  "✅ No null pointer exceptions\n" ++
  "✅ Compile-time error detection\n" ++
  "✅ Algebraic data types express exact intent\n" ++
  "✅ No runtime type coercion surprises"

-- 3. Immutability by Default
-- All data structures are immutable, preventing many bugs

  "🚀 No garbage collection pauses (persistent data)\n" ++
  "🚀 Parallel processing built-in\n" ++
  "⚠️  Startup overhead vs interpreted languages\n" ++
  "⚠️  Learning curve for imperative programmers"

-- 5. Distribution and Synchronization
-- Unison's distributed computing model

distributionModel : Text
distributionModel = 
  "Distributed computing advantages:\n" ++
  "🌐 Automatic code distribution\n" ++
  "🌐 Conflict-free merge capabilities\n" ++
  "🌐 Location-independent references\n" ++
